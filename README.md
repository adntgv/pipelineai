# What it is?
This application is a visual pipeline builder for creating automated workflows. It allows users to add different types of blocks such as prompts, Google search, web crawling, and image recognition, and connect them in a sequence to create a pipeline. The user can then run the pipeline and see the output of each block in real-time. The application also allows users to save and load different pipelines, and rename them as needed. It is built using Svelte and the SMUI library for the UI components.
